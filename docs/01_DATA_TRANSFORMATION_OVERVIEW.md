Scattered Information → Partial profiles across sources
```

### TO: Unified & Normalized
```
1 Unified Database → Consistent structure
151,088 Unique Profiles → Duplicates merged
41 Standardized Categories → Hierarchical taxonomy
Normalized Names → Consistent formatting
Complete Profiles → Information merged from all sources
```

## Detailed Transformations

### 1. Name Normalization

**FROM:**

    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "display_name": "Dr. John Smith, PhD"
  }
}
```

### 2. Expertise Normalization

**FROM: Chaotic Variations**
```
Speaker 1: ["AI", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning"]
Speaker 2: ["artificial intelligence", "ML", "neural networks"]
Speaker 3: ["A.I.", "computer vision", "NLP"]
```

**TO: Unified Taxonomy**
```json
{
  "expertise": {
    "primary_categories": ["artificial_intelligence"],

- "$15000"
- "Call for pricing"

**TO:**
```json
{
  "speaking_info": {
    "fee_range": {
      "min": 10000,
      "max": 20000,
      "currency": "USD",
      "display": "$10,000 - $20,000",
      "category": "10k-20k",
      "negotiable": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Quality Tier Integration

**FROM llm_parsed_db:**
- cat_1: Highest quality (5,299 profiles)
- cat_2: High quality (22,251 profiles)
- cat_3: Medium quality (37,338 profiles)
- cat_4: Lower quality (39,177 profiles)

**TO:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "data_quality_tier": "cat_1",
    "profile_score": 85,
    "verification_status": "verified"
  }
}
```

### 6. Education Data Enhancement

**FROM:**
- Unstructured text in biography
- Missing from most sources

**TO:**
```json
{
  "education": {
    "degrees": ["PhD in Computer Science", "MBA"],
    "institutions": ["MIT", "Stanford"],
    "fields_of_study": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Business Administration"]
  }
}
```
