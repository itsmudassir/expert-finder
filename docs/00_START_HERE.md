## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're a **developer** wanting to run the V4 system:
```bash
# Run the V4 enhanced consolidation
python3 consolidate_speakers_v4_enhanced.py

# Query with market-standard filters
python3 query_speakers_v4_enhanced.py --help

# Example: Find diverse AI experts who do keynotes
python3 query_speakers_v4_enhanced.py \
