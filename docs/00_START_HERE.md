# ðŸ“š Expert Finder Documentation Guide

Welcome to the Expert Finder project documentation! This guide will help you navigate through the documentation in the correct order.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Expert Finder consolidates speaker data from 10+ different sources into a unified, searchable database with advanced normalization capabilities. The system processes over 154,000 raw records into ~151,000 unique speaker profiles.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

If you're a **developer** wanting to run the system:
```bash
# Run the latest consolidation
python3 consolidate_speakers_v3_full.py

# Query the database
python3 query_speakers_v3.py --help
```

If you're a **product manager** understanding capabilities:
- Start with guides 1, 2, and 7
- Focus on transformation benefits and market gaps

If you're a **data engineer** implementing normalizations:
- Start with guides 2, 3, and 6
- Review the technical consolidation approaches

## ðŸ“Š Current Capabilities

### âœ… What We Have Normalized:
- **Expertise**: 41 categories from 34,000+ variations
- **Industries**: 15 categories from 274+ variations  
- **Locations**: Country/state/city standardization
- **Names**: Consistent formatting
- **Fee Ranges**: Standardized brackets

### ðŸš§ Market-Standard Features To Add:
- Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
- Professional certifications
- Speaking experience metrics
- Real-time availability
- Audience parameters
- Much more (see guide #7)

## ðŸ”— Key Resources

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/itsmudassir/expert-finder
- **MongoDB**: `mongodb://admin:dev2018@5.161.225.172:27017/?authSource=admin`
- **Latest Database**: `expert_finder_unified_v3`

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact

- **Before**: 10 databases, 162,453 inconsistent records
