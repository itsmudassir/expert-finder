## 1. Document Counts by Collection

| Collection | Total Documents | Percentage of Total |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| cat_1      | 5,299          | 5.1%                |
| cat_2      | 22,251         | 21.4%               |
| cat_3      | 37,338         | 35.9%               |
| cat_4      | 39,177         | 37.6%               |
| **Total**  | **104,065**    | **100%**            |

## 2. Schema Structure

All four collections share the same schema with the following fields:

- `_id`: ObjectId (MongoDB default)
- `id`: Integer (custom identifier)
- `speaker_name`: String
- `job_title`: String
- `bio`: String
- `location`: String
- `field_of_expertise`: Array of strings
- `education`: Array
- `event_types`: Array

### Field Completeness Analysis

| Field | cat_1 | cat_2 | cat_3 | cat_4 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **field_of_expertise** (has values) | 99.9% | 95.2% | 80.0% | 58.2% |
| **education** (present) | 99.6% | 85.6% | 47.1% | 20.6% |
| **event_types** (present) | 99.9% | 27.8% | 18.8% | 9.2% |
| **location** (present) | ~100% | 93.2% | 68.6% | 46.3% |

**Key Observations:**
- Data quality decreases from cat_1 to cat_4
- cat_1 has the most complete data with nearly all fields populated
- cat_4 has significant missing data, especially for education (79.4% missing) and event_types (90.8% missing)

## 3. Expertise Field Analysis

### Sample Expertise Values by Collection

#### cat_1 (Most specialized/curated)
- Game Development, Startup Funding, Technical Direction
- Securities litigation, White collar criminal defense
- Design, Strategy, Technology
- Marketing, Financial markets, Artificial Intelligence

#### cat_2 (Mixed specialties)
- Family law, Trusts and estates, Feminist jurisprudence
- Software development, Infinispan, Quarkus
- Waterproofing systems, Research
- International business expansion, Startup fundraising

#### cat_3 (Broader categories)
- Human rights, Gender, Health, Technology, Environment
- Growth and innovation, Product-led growth, Digital self-service
- Accessibility, Software Engineering
- Business, Technology, Product management

#### cat_4 (Most general)
- eCommerce, Paid advertising, Influencers
- Bluegrass, New Grass (music)
- Business, Sustainability
- Media, Technology

### Most Common Expertise Areas

The expertise fields show different patterns across collections:
- **cat_1**: More specific professional expertise (securities litigation, game development)
- **cat_2**: Mix of academic and professional fields
- **cat_3**: Broader technology and business categories
- **cat_4**: Very general categories with less specificity

## 4. Data Quality Issues

### Duplicate Speaker Names

| Collection | Top Duplicate | Count |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| cat_1      | Lee Carroll   | 4     |
| cat_2      | "None"        | 92    |
| cat_3      | "None"        | 581   |
| cat_4      | "None"        | 1,953 |

**Major Issues:**
1. Large number of "None" values for speaker names in cat_2, cat_3, and cat_4
2. Some speakers appear multiple times with potentially different expertise areas
3. Data quality degrades significantly from cat_1 to cat_4

---

## 5. Unique Features by Collection

### Event Types Field
- **cat_1**: Well-populated (99.9% have values)
  - Examples: FakUgesi, Comic Con, Campus Game Jam, design talks
- **cat_2-4**: Mostly missing (72-91% missing)

### Location Field
- **cat_1**: Nearly complete (>99%)
- **cat_4**: Only 46.3% have location data

### Education Field
- **cat_1**: 99.6% have education data
- **cat_4**: Only 20.6% have education data

---

## 6. Recommendations

1. **Data Categorization**: The collections appear to represent different quality tiers:
   - cat_1: High-quality, verified speaker data
   - cat_2: Medium-quality data with some gaps
   - cat_3: Lower-quality data with significant gaps
   - cat_4: Lowest quality with minimal verification

2. **For Expert Finding**:
   - Prioritize cat_1 for high-confidence matches
   - Use cat_2 as a secondary source
   - cat_3 and cat_4 should be used with caution due to data quality issues

3. **Data Cleaning Needed**:
   - Remove or handle "None" speaker name entries
   - Standardize expertise field values
   - Fill missing location and education data where possible
   - Deduplicate speaker records

4. **Indexing Recommendations**:
   - Create compound index on (speaker_name, field_of_expertise)
   - Text index on bio field for full-text search
   - Index on field_of_expertise for expertise-based queries
