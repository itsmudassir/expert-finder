    "description": "Described by the media as everything from \u201cSuperwoman undercover\u201d to \u201cThe Pied Piper of potential,\u201d Sarah Robb O\u2019Hagan is an executive, entrepreneur, author, and founder of Extreme Living \u2014 a content platform designed to help individuals, teams, and organizations play to their highest potential. She is a leading global thought leader in the conversation around the future of work, having pioneered a new blueprint for workplace culture during her tenure as the CEO of EXOS, the human performance coaching company. This approach which she rolled out to Fortune 100 clients proved to not only increase productivity and performance but significantly reduce employee disengagement and burnout.\n\nSarah is a rare blend of fierce businesswoman, cheerleading Mom, passionate women\u2019s advocate, and high-energy innovator. In fast-paced presentations and in her book, Extreme You: Step Up, Stand Out, Kick Ass, Repeat, Sarah lays out a roadmap for becoming the most \u201cextreme\u201d version of yourself by playing to your own unique passions and strengths, and by building highly-collaborative, focused, and successful teams and corporations. Drawing on her decades of experience at some of the world\u2019s most influential brands, she shares practical takeaways including how to get comfortable making bold moves and using failures in work or life to come back stronger, how to discover your most competitive playing field, and most importantly, how to tune your own mind and body for best performance in a fast-paced, hybrid work world so you can also empower the kind of teamwork that brings out the best in everyone else. She is exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau.\n\nProfessionally, Sarah is widely regarded as a transformational leader having personally led groundbreaking innovations in her corporate career. Her achievements include reimagining Gatorade as a cutting-edge sports performance brand, orchestrating the iconic Virgin Atlantic Airways partnership with the Austin Powers movie, transitioning Equinox into a dynamic, always-on, digital-first fitness business, and navigating the successful transformation of her most recent company, EXOS, during the pandemic.\n\nShe is also not afraid to talk about what she calls her \u201ccanyon of career despair\u201d in her 20s, using major back-to-back failures to learn, grow, and motivate herself forward to eventually lead a $5 billion global business by the age of 38. Sarah shares firsthand accounts of these peaks and valleys \u2014 pairing stories of firings with a behind-the-scenes look at Gatorade\u2019s transformational turnaround under her stewardship \u2014 to illustrate what it truly takes to be successful. She teaches us why you learn more when you play for all or nothing, the importance of humility, and why you must always \u201cplay your own game.\u201d She also taps into her own experiences with extreme burnout after giving birth to her third child in the midst of the Gatorade turnaround. Sarah discusses how it informed the work she did at EXOS, helping corporate clients and executives around the world to lead healthy, high performing teams.\n\nSarah Robb O\u2019Hagan has been named twice to Forbes magazine\u2019s list of the \u201cMost Powerful Women in Sports,\u201d named a \u201cWoman to Watch\u201d by Ad Age magazine, dubbed one of the \u201cMost Creative People in Business\u201d by Fast Company, and named to \u201c40 Under 40\u201d lists by Sports Business Journal, Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, and Sports Goods Business. She also complements her operating experience with board service, having served on the board of Strava, as well as her current role as an independent director for JetBlue Airways.\n\nSarah is a passionate advocate for an active lifestyle and believes the lessons learned from sports and fitness can be applied to improve performance in the workplace. She has served on Hillary Clinton\u2019s U.S. State Department Council to Empower Women and Girls through Sports and is a trustee of the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation. She is an active member of the World Class New Zealand Network, as she remains committed to helping the country\u2019s development, international competitiveness, and economic growth. In 2016, she was awarded the Sir Peter Blake Trust Award for outstanding leadership, and in 2018 she was named a \u201cWISE\u201d Woman of the Year.",

Largely skipping her maternity leave, the combination of extreme hours and late-night childcare led her to experience an extreme and painful \u201cburnout\u201d that changed her perspective and her approach to work life forever.\nYears later \u2014 taking on the role of CEO at EXOS, the human performance company, at the start of the global pandemic \u2014 she decided that a successful business turnaround while burning people out was not an option. As a result, she partnered with the performance science experts on her team, as well as some of the best organizational psychologists in the world to design and implement a far more sustainable and enjoyable way of getting business results while working under immense pressure.\nIn this talk, Sarah outlines:"

With her decades-long career, predominantly in the sports and human performance industry, she has seen up close what epic teamwork looks like and how the common characteristics of great teams translate seamlessly from the world of sports to business.\nWith this talk, she explains:\nWith anecdotes from her days working for highly team-oriented corporate cultures (including Nike and Virgin), as well as insight into the strategies she used while transforming major global companies, she describes what it means to build and contribute to an \u201cextreme team,\u201d how to work through intergenerational workforce dynamics, and how to get proximate with those least like yourself to truly understand the unique gifts that individuals can contribute to your team."

Stepping into her role as CEO of EXOS in early February 2020, she found herself not in the \u201cdream job\u201d she thought she had just accepted, but in the fight of her life leading a business that consisted of hundreds of brick-and-mortar gym sites around the world, which would be severely impaired by the global pandemic. Despite the complexities surrounding them, she and her team kept the business afloat and evolved it into a far stronger company as they shifted their focused to tackling the next phase of its growth. Earlier in her career, she had successfully led the turnaround of the $5 billion Gatorade business in the midst of a global recession after inheriting what the media called a \u201cflaming mess,\u201d so she knew the playbook and how it needed to be adapted to succeed in the big, long climb ahead of her.\nThese successful turnarounds, as well as her decades in the human performance industry have taught her innumerable lessons about succeeding in life and business, the most important being this: There is no way to get through life without experiencing adversity; Knowing how to harness the lessons to bounce back stronger is a skill everyone should have.\nWith this speech, Sarah outlines:\nContinue Reading \u00bb"

As the author of best-selling management books, General McChrystal offers a battle-tested system for detecting and responding to risk.

Called \u201cone of America\u2019s greatest warriors\u201d by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, few can speak about leadership, teamwork, and international affairs/geopolitics with as much insight.\n\nFor more than ten years, the McChrystal Group has advised companies on how to thrive as the world changes. The McChrystal Group\u00a0designs custom business solutions and leadership development programs to cultivate trust, empowerment, common purpose, and shared knowledge across organizations. With these skills, General McChrystal will explain how your organization can operate as a nimble \u201cteam of teams,\u201d which is essential in today\u2019s competitive and rapidly-changing business landscape.\n\nLeading in Uncertain Times.

When old systems fall short, he believes true leaders must look for ways to innovate and change.

She honed her animated style serving as the popular, lively Chief Economist for CNBC, where she became a household name and a must-watch source of financial news. The former co-host of the well-known \u201cpre-market\u201d morning news and talk show Squawk Box, Rossell is revered for taking complex economic issues, often dull in the button-down business press, and making them relevant to people's lives, families, and careers.\n\nExclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, she discusses America\u2019s current and future role in the global economy, factors responsible for recessions, how Washington influences Wall Street and the markets, and the specific forecast for the U.S. economy over the course of the next 18-24 months. She is also well-versed in the stock market, investor behavior, consumer confidence, and what accountable capitalism looks like this year and beyond. With a knack for making complex topics more digestible, Rossell\u2019s authentic, high-energy talks deliver a stimulating and often optimistic economic outlook, providing an insider\u2019s perspective on key factors of economic disruption. Her creative, thought-provoking commentary will ring in the audience members' ears well after she leaves the stage.\n\nPrior to her career in broadcast journalism, Marci served as Corporate Economist and Investment Spokesperson for OppenheimerFunds, one of the nation\u2019s largest mutual fund companies.
