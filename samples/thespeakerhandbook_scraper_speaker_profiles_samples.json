    "biography": "Meet Jaco van Gass\nJaco Van Gass is a 4x British Paralympic Gold Medallist and British Armed Forces veteran.\nMoving from South Africa to England aged 20, Jaco joined the elite Parachute Regiment in the British Armed Forces. During his second tour of Afghanistan in 2009, Jaco was hit by an RPG (Rocket-Propelled Grenade). His injuries included the loss of his left arm at the elbow, a collapsed lung, punctured internal organs, shrapnel wounds, and multiple fractures. He underwent 11 surgeries and intense rehabilitation. Incredibly, he survived.\nDespite the end of his military career and the physical and mental trauma, Jaco refused to let his injuries define him. He went on to become a first-class downhill skier, marathon runner, and a member of the record-breaking team of wounded soldiers who trekked unsupported to the North Pole (alongside Prince Harry). He also climbed Mt. Denali in Alaska.\nJaco later joined the GB Para-Cycling Team, where he has gone onto become an 11-time World Champion.\nFulfilling a lifelong dream, Jaco competed at Tokyo 2020 Games winning two Gold medals, one Bronze medal and setting three World Records. Jaco returned to the Olympics for Paris 2024, where he defended his titles to win a further two Gold medals and broke two of his own World Records.\nJaco is now a sought-after motivational speaker, inspiring businesses, charities, and organisations around the world. He shares the highs and lows of his extraordinary journey, helping others to embrace change, overcome adversity, and achieve their goals.",

        "title": "Telling Stories that Inform, Influence, and Inspire",
        "description": "Great leaders, communicators, and influencers have one thing in common: they know how to tell a great story. In a world overwhelmed with information, clear and meaningful communication is more critical than ever. Those who can tell compelling stories gain a significant advantage in building trust, influencing decisions, and inspiring change. Important messages often go unheard\u2014not because they lack value, but because they aren\u2019t told in a way that captures attention and drives action. It\u2019s not enough to tell a story; how you tell it determines its impact. Without the right structure, emotional connection, or audience relevance, even the best intentions can fall flat. While AI can generate information, it can\u2019t replace the human ability to create connection, trust, and meaning. No matter how advanced technology becomes, people will always need to communicate ideas, motivate teams, and build relationships. The ability to craft and tell compelling stories remains essential in every industry and role. This talk makes storytelling accessible by breaking it down into simple, science-backed techniques. Karen reveals how to leverage the Factory Settings of the Brain to craft stories that inform, influence, and inspire. She addresses common challenges including where to find compelling story ideas, how to structure them for maximum impact, and how to tailor them to different audiences. This talk covers: Why some stories work\u2014and why others don\u2019t\u2014based on brain science. How to build a toolbox of potential story ideas. Defining your audience and ensuring your story serves its purpose. Applying a simple, memorable structure for clarity and impact. Using detail and emotion to make stories unforgettable. Whether you are leading a team, pitching an idea, selling a product, communicating data, or navigating difficult conversations, this keynote will give you the tools to tell stories that truly connect and drive results."

        "description": "We live in a data-rich era, with insights, patterns, and even predictions of behavior. Yet, many presentations lack meaningful insights. Leaders often ask people to \u201cshow the data,\u201d leading to complicated charts and excessive details that fail to resonate with the audience. People question and debate the data instead of taking action. Data can be overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Stories can bring data to life by providing context, creating a common understanding, and fostering discussion\u2014especially when differing perspectives are involved. Storytelling with data transforms complex information, establishes trust, and facilitates decision-making. Data doesn\u2019t change behavior\u2014emotions do. Crafting a data story that taps into your audience\u2019s emotions can help them connect with and understand the information. This skill is more critical than ever in today\u2019s fast-paced, information-heavy world. Yet we often struggle with how to tell a compelling data story. Many default to fancy charts and graphs, expecting the numbers to speak for themselves while neglecting the narrative entirely. This keynote explores the art and science of data storytelling, offering strategies to captivate audiences, clarify insights, and inspire action. You\u2019ll learn how to move beyond visuals and structure your data story to make your data truly impactful. This talk covers: The science behind storytelling and decision-making with data. Debunking myths around storytelling with data. Understanding the emotional impact of data on your audience. Why data storytelling goes beyond data visualization. Recognizing when to tell a story with data. Defining your audience and aligning your data story with desired outcomes. Determining the recommended actions your data should inspire. Structuring your data story for clarity and engagement. Avoiding common pitfalls in data storytelling. The critical role leaders play in shaping and delivering data stories."

        "description": "Culture is more than a priority; it&#8217;s the operating system of every organization. Yet, many struggle to cultivate a flexible culture that thrives amidst today&#8217;s evolving business landscape. Culture transcends office walls\u2014it&#8217;s shaped and reinforced through everyday interactions, not through annual surveys or values posted in lobbies. Every culture tells a story through its teams and how values are demonstrated day-to-day. The story of your culture is told as your employees talk to fellow team members, friends, family, and possibly recruits. Understanding and shaping this story is key to creating a work environment that reflects your values and fosters genuine engagement. As a former Global Head of Culture at General Electric and Head of Leadership Development at Deloitte, Karen helps organizations and teams implement practical behaviors at all levels to shape culture. This researched, story-based talk includes the neuroscience of culture, common challenges organizations and teams face, and actionable strategies and tactics to uncover and shape the story of your culture. This talk includes: Myths of organizational culture. Discovering the role of storytelling in shaping organizational culture. Uncovering the stories of your organization. Empowering leaders and employees to shape culture. Proven tactics that shape culture on teams. Whether you&#8217;re a business leader, team leader, HR professional, or employee, this keynote equips you with the insights and tools to harness the storytelling for sustainable success."

But as the needs of employees, leaders, and businesses evolve, it\u2019s time to rethink workplace dynamics, leadership styles, and behaviors that shape culture. This keynote weaves storytelling, research, and practical insights to uncover where these habits come from, why they no longer serve us, and what to do instead.

        "title": "Telling Stories that Inform, Influence, and Inspire",
        "description": "Great leaders, communicators, and influencers have one thing in common: they know how to tell a great story. In a world overwhelmed with information, clear and meaningful communication is more critical than ever. Those who can tell compelling stories gain a significant advantage in building trust, influencing decisions, and inspiring change.\nImportant messages often go unheard\u2014not because they lack value, but because they aren\u2019t told in a way that captures attention and drives action. It\u2019s not enough to tell a story; how you tell it determines its impact. Without the right structure, emotional connection, or audience relevance, even the best intentions can fall flat.\nWhile AI can generate information, it can\u2019t replace the human ability to create connection, trust, and meaning. No matter how advanced technology becomes, people will always need to communicate ideas, motivate teams, and build relationships. The ability to craft and tell compelling stories remains essential in every industry and role.\nThis talk makes storytelling accessible by breaking it down into simple, science-backed techniques. Karen reveals how to leverage the Factory Settings of the Brain to craft stories that inform, influence, and inspire. She addresses common challenges including where to find compelling story ideas, how to structure them for maximum impact, and how to tailor them to different audiences.\nThis talk covers:\n\nWhy some stories work\u2014and why others don\u2019t\u2014based on brain science.\nHow to build a toolbox of potential story ideas.\nDefining your audience and ensuring your story serves its purpose.\nApplying a simple, memorable structure for clarity and impact.\nUsing detail and emotion to make stories unforgettable.\n\nWhether you are leading a team, pitching an idea, selling a product, communicating data, or navigating difficult conversations, this keynote will give you the tools to tell stories that truly connect and drive results."

        "title": "Storytelling with Data: From Insights to Impact",
        "description": "We live in a data-rich era, with insights, patterns, and even predictions of behavior. Yet, many presentations lack meaningful insights. Leaders often ask people to \u201cshow the data,\u201d leading to complicated charts and excessive details that fail to resonate with the audience. People question and debate the data instead of taking action.\nData can be overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Stories can bring data to life by providing context, creating a common understanding, and fostering discussion\u2014especially when differing perspectives are involved. Storytelling with data transforms complex information, establishes trust, and facilitates decision-making.\nData doesn\u2019t change behavior\u2014emotions do. Crafting a data story that taps into your audience\u2019s emotions can help them connect with and understand the information. This skill is more critical than ever in today\u2019s fast-paced, information-heavy world. Yet we often struggle with how to tell a compelling data story. Many default to fancy charts and graphs, expecting the numbers to speak for themselves while neglecting the narrative entirely.\nThis keynote explores the art and science of data storytelling, offering strategies to captivate audiences, clarify insights, and inspire action. You\u2019ll learn how to move beyond visuals and structure your data story to make your data truly impactful.\nThis talk covers:\n\nThe science behind storytelling and decision-making with data.\nDebunking myths around storytelling with data.\nUnderstanding the emotional impact of data on your audience.\nWhy data storytelling goes beyond data visualization.\nRecognizing when to tell a story with data.\nDefining your audience and aligning your data story with desired outcomes.\nDetermining the recommended actions your data should inspire.\nStructuring your data story for clarity and engagement.\nAvoiding common pitfalls in data storytelling.\nThe critical role leaders play in shaping and delivering data stories."

        "description": "Culture is more than a priority; it\u2019s the operating system of every organization. Yet, many struggle to cultivate a flexible culture that thrives amidst today\u2019s evolving business landscape. Culture transcends office walls\u2014it\u2019s shaped and reinforced through everyday interactions, not through annual surveys or values posted in lobbies.\nEvery culture tells a story through its teams and how values are demonstrated day-to-day. The story of your culture is told as your employees talk to fellow team members, friends, family, and possibly recruits. Understanding and shaping this story is key to creating a work environment that reflects your values and fosters genuine engagement.\nAs a former Global Head of Culture at General Electric and Head of Leadership Development at Deloitte, Karen helps organizations and teams implement practical behaviors at all levels to shape culture. This researched, story-based talk includes the neuroscience of culture, common challenges organizations and teams face, and actionable strategies and tactics to uncover and shape the story of your culture. This talk includes:\n\nMyths of organizational culture.\nDiscovering the role of storytelling in shaping organizational culture.\nUncovering the stories of your organization.\nEmpowering leaders and employees to shape culture.\nProven tactics that shape culture on teams.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a business leader, team leader, HR professional, or employee, this keynote equips you with the insights and tools to harness the storytelling for sustainable success."
